Gallery HTML Code
================

This HTML code creates a simple image gallery with four items. Each item consists of an image, a title, a subtitle, and some information text. The gallery is styled using an external CSS file (`gallery.css`).

Features:

* Responsive design for mobile devices
* Image overlays with title, subtitle, and info text
* External stylesheet for customizing the gallery's appearance

Usage:

1. Create a new HTML file and copy the code into it.
2. Create a new CSS file named `gallery.css` and add your custom styles.
3. Replace the image file names with your own image files.

Function: hasTargetSumSubarray Purpose: Check if there is a subarray in the given array that sums up to the target value.

Description: This function takes two inputs:

arr: The input array of numbers.
target: The target sum value.
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether a subarray exists in the input array that sums up to the target value.

Algorithm:

Initialize the current sum to 0 and the left pointer to 0.
Iterate through the array using the right pointer.
Add the current element to the current sum.
While the current sum is greater than the target and the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer, subtract the element at the left pointer from the current sum and move the left pointer to the right.
If the current sum is equal to the target, return true.
If no subarray is found that sums up to the target, return false.
Example Usage:

Copy code
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const target = 7;
console.log(hasTargetSumSubarray(arr, target)); // Output: true (subarray [2, 3, 2] sums up to 7)
Note: This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

Function: transformString Purpose: Transform a given string based on its length.

Description: This function takes a single input:

str: The input string to be transformed.
The function returns a transformed string based on the length of the input string.

Transformation Rules:

If the length of the input string is divisible by 15, perform both operations:
Replace each character with its ASCII code.
Reverse the entire string.
If the length of the input string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length of the input string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
Example Usage:

Copy code
const str = "hello";
console.log(transformString(str)); // Output: "104 101 108 108 111" (ASCII codes)

const str2 = "abcdef";
console.log(transformString(str2)); // Output: "fedcba" (reversed string)

const str3 = "abcdefghijk";
console.log(transformString(str3)); // Output: "107 104 101 99 98 97 102 101 100 99 98" (ASCII codes and reversed)
Note: This function uses the modulo operator (%) to determine the divisibility of the input string's length. The transformation rules are applied based on the remainder of the division.
