Gallery HTML Code
================

This HTML code creates a simple image gallery with four items. Each item consists of an image, a title, a subtitle, and some information text. The gallery is styled using an external CSS file (`gallery.css`).

Features:

* Responsive design for mobile devices
* Image overlays with title, subtitle, and info text
* External stylesheet for customizing the gallery's appearance

Usage:

1. Create a new HTML file and copy the code into it.
2. Create a new CSS file named `gallery.css` and add your custom styles.
3. Replace the image file names with your own image files.
